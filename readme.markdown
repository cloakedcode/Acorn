# Acorn - a PHP toolkit to speed up development

## What Acorn is:

The term framework likely brings to mind Ruby on Rails or CakePHP or something of that sort. Acorn isn't like those. Acorn does as much as it can with as little as possible. In other words, it simplifies the code you rewrite for every new project and stays out of your way. Acorn is not a framework. It doesn't try to solve all your problems.

## What Acorn is NOT:

* Acorn is not a framework.
* Acorn doesn't make you write better code.
* Acorn does not have supercow powers.

## The ideas behind Acorn (similar to those of [uno](/breck7/uno)):

* Don't rewrite PHP (use what exists already).
* URL rewriting is nice sometimes but Acorn doesn't rewrite everything. Get variables? Use 'em! Pretty URLs? Use 'em! But don't use one to replace the other.
* SQL is a beautiful thing, when you know how to use it. Once you've mastered it you can write code that's faster than any framework could ever hope to produce. Just want to update one column in a row? That's easy. Want a single column in all rows in a particular order? That's easy.
